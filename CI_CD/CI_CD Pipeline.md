### CI/CD Dev Pipelines

- **Purpose**

  - CI/CD pipelines are automated processes in software development that allow for the rapid and reliable delivery of code changes. The CI (Continuous Integration) part involves automatically testing and merging code changes into a central repository, while the CD (Continuous Deployment or Continuous Delivery) part automates the delivery of the code changes to a production or staging environment.

- **Continuous Integration**
  - Focuses on integrating work frequently to detect errors quickly, improve quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.
- **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**

  - Automates the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments. Continuous Deployment goes one step further by automatically releasing every change to production, while Continuous Delivery requires manual approval to do so.

- **Conclusion**

  - By integrating tools like Jenkins, Terraform, Spinnaker, and AquaSec into CI/CD pipelines, organisations can automate the process of software delivery from code to production, ensuring faster releases, infrastructure management, and security.
