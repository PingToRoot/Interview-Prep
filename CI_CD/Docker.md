### Docker

- **Purpose**
  - Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
- **Key Features**:
  - Allows developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardised executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
  - Supports rapid, consistent deployment and scaling.
  - Facilitates isolation and security.
- **Role in CI/CD**:
  - Docker containers offer a consistent environment for the application from development through to production, mitigating the "it works on my machine" problem.
  - Enables easy integration and deployment phases in CI/CD pipelines by allowing the same Docker container to be pushed through various pipeline stages.
