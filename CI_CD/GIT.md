### Git

- **Purpose**
  - Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
- **Key Features**
  - Enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
  - Each developer works on their own copy of the project, and changes are merged into a central repository.
  - Supports non-linear development through branches and enables multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other.
- **Role in CI/CD**

  - The backbone of the CI/CD process, allowing developers to frequently merge changes into the main branch, where automated builds and tests run.
  - Facilitates tracking of every change by every developer, ensuring that developers can collaborate effectively, resolving conflicts and merging code for continuous integration and deployment.
